##Technologies
* ReactJS : Fast rendered which help me to create a reusable components and maintainable application.
* Babel   : Compiles ES6 to ES5.
* Webpack : Bundles npm packages and JS files into a single file. I also includes hot reloading to avoid refresh all the browser when made a change.
* Browsersync : Help for the testing and debugging on multiple devices.
* Mocha  : Automated tests with Chai for assertions and Enzyme for React Components, using jsdom I could test   without a browser.
* ESLint : Reports syntax and style issues.Besides I used eslint-plugin-react for additional ReactJS rules.
* SASS   : Compiled CSS styles.
